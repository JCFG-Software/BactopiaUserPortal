# Staphbook
"A social network for genomes"

StaphBook is a web app that reads from a PostGres SQL database and displays Staphylococcus aureus genomes in an easy to read format. With this app users are able to: 
- browse genomes and view information such as isolation source and sequence data and be able to download the information as .csv files. 
- find similar genomes by shared information such as isolation sources and by genetic distance 
- favorite and tag samples by adding them to a group which can then be shared and viewed by other users
- annotate groups and view generic statistics about each group
